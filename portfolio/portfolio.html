        Bluff, Paper, Scissors is a mutation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, but with a twist of wits. Two players start by informing their opponent of which hand they are (presumably) going to play: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. A battle of mindgames ensues, in which the players try to figure out whether or not their opponent is telling the truth about their next move. The players throw out their hands, and points are awarded to the winning player. But know this: Players are rewarded for being truthful!

        The players in this game are rocket engineers. The players are tasked with gathering materials together to assemble a spaceship to go to the moon. However, one mystery player is trying to sabotage the crew to stop them from building the ship, in fear of unknown elements on the moon. Will the team successfully construct the ship? Or will the villain succeed, stopping the rocket from launching?
